# Virtual Monitor MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to provide a virtual GUI interface for headless computer units (VMware, QEMU, etc.). This allows AI agents to interact with GUI environments as if they were human users, enabling automated GUI development, testing, and interaction.

## Core Features

1.  **Virtual Monitor Creation**: Establish a virtual display on headless systems (e.g., VMware, QEMU) to provide a visual interface for headless environments.
2.  **GUI Interaction**: Provide capabilities similar to `pyautogui`, including:
    *   Screen reading/capturing.
    *   Mouse movements and clicks.
    *   Keyboard input.
3.  **Agent-Driven Automation**: Enable AI agents to autonomously operate a computer to perform GUI-based tasks, such as software development and testing, directly from a CLI environment.
4.  **VNC-based Monitoring**: Support visual monitoring of the virtual monitor's state (screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs) via VNC protocols (e.g., TightVNC).
5.  **Web-based Monitoring Interface**: The MCP server will host a web server to allow users and agents to monitor the virtual desktop in real-time through a browser.

## Goals

The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between CLI-driven AI agents and GUI-centric software environments, allowing agents to interact with any desktop environment with the same proficiency as a human user.
